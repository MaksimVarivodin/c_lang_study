## Introduction

C is a powerful and versatile programming language that has been widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and operating system development. The book "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie provides a comprehensive introduction to the language, covering its syntax, semantics, and advanced features.

This project aims to follow the revision plan outlined in the book, providing code examples and exercises to reinforce the concepts covered.

## Revision Plan

The revision plan is based on the chapters and topics covered in the book. Each chapter will have corresponding code examples and exercises to help you understand and practice the concepts.

1. Introduction to C
2. Types, Operators, and Expressions
3. Control Flow
4. Functions and Program Structure
5. Pointers and Arrays
6. Structures
7. Input and Output
8. The UNIX System Interface
9. The Preprocessor
10. Libraries and Header Files
11. Error Handling
12. Storage Classes and Linkage
13. Initialization
14. Memory Management
15. Advanced Data Types
16. C Preprocessor and Macros
17. Advanced Functions
18. The GNU C Compiler
19. Standard Library Functions
20. Advanced Topics

## Code Examples

Each chapter will have code examples and exercises to help you understand and practice the concepts. You can find the code examples in the `code` directory of this project.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 3;
    int sum = a + b;

    printf("Sum of %d and %d is %d\n", a, b, sum);

    return 0;
